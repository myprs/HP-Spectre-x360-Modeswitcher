# HP-Spectre-x360-Modeswitcher

Helper scripts to use the tablet and laptop mode of the HP Spectre x360 Convertible Laptop under Ubuntu.

I have not made it to a working release, please see the development branch for the code, which is quite usabel yet but integration into the system is lacking. I did publish this when I did discover that I did get one star for an empty repo already! Any help and ideas appreciated!
